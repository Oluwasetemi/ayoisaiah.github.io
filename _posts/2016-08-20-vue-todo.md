[Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) is a JavaScript Library that makes building web applications easy and reactive. In simple terms, it helps you convert data objects (model) in your application to HTML (view) and binds the DOM to the underlying data so that if your data changes, the page is updated accordingly.

## Target Audience

This tutorial is targeted at beginner developers who have a reasonable understanding of JavaScript and the DOM but do not have any experience with a framework.

People who could fit into this category are:

- Anyone who can do some basic apps with HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery
- Beginners who have completed the Front-End section of Free Code Camp
- Those who rely on jQuery exclusively for DOM manipulation

**This tutorial is not for**

- Complete newbies to JavaScript. Please take the time to understand the core concepts first before learning abstractions. [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com) is a great place to start.

- People who already have in-depth knowledge of Vue.js, Angular.js, Ember.js, React or similar frameworks.

## What we'll be building

We are going to build a simple [to-do list app](https://jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/) with the following user stories:

1. User can add a single todo item at a time.
2. User can delete a single item.
3. User can clear the whole list.
4. User can mark single items as completed.
5. User can mark all items as completed.

You can view the code and a live demo of the app on [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/)

It is considered best practice to always break down complex tasks into small sequential steps that can be completed in succession because it reduces the tendency to feel overwhelmed and exhausted as is the case when battling with large chunks of work.

I'm going to explain how each feature was implemented step-by-step so hopefully you should have a good understanding of how everything works together at the end of this tutorial.

**If you get stuck while working through this tutorial...**

Drop a comment below or [send me an email](mailto:sudo@ayoisaiah.com).I'll respond to your questions as soon as I can.

## Getting Started

I will be using JSFiddle for this tutorial and I will embed snapshots of each step on this page. I highly recommend that you follow along, typing each step out all the way to the end.

### Adding Vue.js to the page

First, we need to grab the Vue.js file and add it to our page. There are [many ways](http://vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) to do this but the simplest way is to load the script from a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/1.0.26/vue.min.js">
</script>
```

If you're using JSFiddle like I am, you can easily add Vue to the page by clicking the JavaScript gear and selecting Vue 1.0.12 under Framework and Extensions.

[Insert Screenshot]

## Creating the Structure

Alright, now that we've added Vue to our page, it's time to setup our HTML. We will create a main container `div` with an id of `events` and a new Vue instance and then bind the two together.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/1/embedded/html,js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

By setting the `el` key to `#todo`, this makes all the elements inside the `#todo` div available to the Vue instance.

### Setting up the panel

In our `section` element with the class `panel`, we will insert three new elements:

- A checkbox to mark all todo items as completed (User story #5).
- An input field for adding new todo items (User story #1).
- A button to clear all the items from the list (User story #3).

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/2/embedded/html,js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The `autofocus` property on our input field focuses the element on page load so that the User can begin to  add items immediately without having to focus the input manually.

### Setting up the list

Now that we have the skeleton for our top panel, let's do the same for the list area where our tasks will be rendered.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/3/embedded/html,js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Basically, each todo item added to the list will be placed in the `li` tag with the `label` containing the text. The checkbox is to mark a single task as completed (User Story #4) while the  `button` with class `delete`  is to remove an item from the list (User Story #2).

### Adding the Styles

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/5/embedded/css,html,js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Flexbox makes centering elements really easy so I've used it here to center the contents of the `section.panel` which holds our input and the `li` element where our individual todos will be rendered. 

If you've never used Flexbox, I recommend that you play [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/) to learn it.

## Getting to the nitty-gritty

Right, we now have the structure and styles for our application. We can start demonstrating the awesome capabilities of Vue.js by giving our todo app some functionality.

But first, lets go over the concepts we need to understand about Vue.

### The Vue Instance

We can create a new Vue instance by using the `Vue()` constructor which lets you bind the data in your model to the view (HTML). You can think of a Vue instance as the view-model.

```javascript
//Create a new Vue instance
new Vue({

  //Bind this Vue instance to our container div with an ID of todo
  el: "#todo",

  //This is where the data for our application will be held
  data: {

  },

  //This is where we will register the methods we want to use in our application
  methods: {

  }
});


```

By setting the `el` key to `#todo`, this makes all the elements inside the `#todo` div available to the Vue instance. The `data` object is where we will register the values that hold data for our application while `methods` will hold all the methods we want to use in our application.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/7/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Two-way data binding using v-model

The `v-model` directive in Vue.js is used to bind data from an input field to a value registered in our `data` object and vice versa. Let's look at a quick demo of how this works:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/pdj3nc6j/4/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The `v-model` attribute on the input field in the HTML is set to the `name` key we registered in the data object of our Vue instance. Now switch to the result tab and change the name in the input field. Notice that the `name` key is updated instantly, just like magic!

**Note**: I added `<pre>{% raw %} {{ $data | json }}{% endraw %}</pre>` in the HTML to display the contents of the `data` object just below our input.  The `json` part is called a filter and it is preceded by the pipe symbol `{% raw %}| {% endraw %}`. A filter formats the value of an expression for display to the user.

The benefit of this is that it allows you to see how things are working under the hood by calling `JSON.stringify()` on the `data` object.

### Listen to DOM Events with v-on

Vue provides another directive `v-on` which we can use to listen to DOM events and call a method when a specified event is triggered on an element.

If you use jQuery, you may have been used to doing something like this:

```javascript

$("element").on("event", function () {
	//Methods go here
};

```

In Vue, the logic is similar but the syntax is far different.

Continuing on from the previous example, lets add a button that will call a function that alerts the name in the input field when the button is clicked.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/pdj3nc6j/6/embedded/html,js,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

I added the `v-on:click` attribute to listen for click events and call the `alertName` method when a click is triggered on the button. If you switch to the JavaScript tab, you will see that I have already registered `alertName` in the `methods` object.

### Displaying data in Vue

Mustache-style bindings are used to display the data from a Vue instance on the page (the View). For example:

```javascript
new Vue({
  el: "#demo",
  data: {
    value: "Hello, how are you?"
  }
});
```

To display the `value` property of our model in our view we need to add the `{% raw %}  {{ value }} {% endraw %}` string in our view like this:

```html

<p>{% raw %} {{ value }} {% endraw %}</p>

```

Here's a proper demo:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/pdj3nc6j/8/embedded/result,js,html" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Go ahead, change the text in the input field. You will see that the text on the screen is updated instantly. This is because the Vue links your data and the DOM together and  the two are kept in sync.

### Rendering lists with `v-for`

We can use the `v-for` directive to render a list of items based on an array in our Model. A special syntax is required in the form of `item in names` where `names` is the array in question while `item` is the current array element being iterated on.

Here's an example:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/pdj3nc6j/9/embedded/js,html,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

If you update the contents of the `names` array, the list will also update accordingly. No need for DOM manipulation.

### What is this?

`this` in the context of event handlers refers to the Vue instance invoking the handler and it is used to access the items in the `data` object.

```javascript

new Vue({
  data: {
    lang: "JavaScript"
  },

  methods: {
    eventHandler: function() {
      //this refers to the Vue instance and it is used to access the lang key in the data object
      console.log(this.lang); //Javascript
    }
  }
});

```

Hopefully, all that makes sense. It's time to combine the concepts we've learnt above to add some functionality to our todo list app.

### Feature 1 - Add a todo item and display it on the page

The first feature we will implement in our app is adding a single todo item to the list through the input field in the top panel.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/11/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

You will see that I've added two new keys to our `data` object:

- `newTask`: This is where we will bind data from our input.
- `taskList`: This is an array where our tasks will be stored.

Now, we will bind the value of the input field to the `newTask` key by setting a `v-model` directive on the input field to `newTask`. Secondly, we will add a `v-on` listener to the input to watch for the enter key and call a method called `addTask` when it is triggered. The syntax is below:

```html
<input type="text" placeholder="What do you need to do?" autofocus class="text-input" v-model="newTask" v-on:keyup.enter="addTask">
```
Finally, let's setup the `addTask` method. We will register it inside the `methods` object as previously alluded to.

```javascript
  
methods: {

    addTask: function() {
      //trim() is used to remove whitespace from both ends of a string
      var task = this.newTask.trim();
      //if task is not an empty string
      if (task) {
        //Push an object containing the task to the taskList array
        this.taskList.push({
          text: task,
          checked: false
        });
        //Reset newTask to an empty string so the input field is cleared
        this.newTask = "";
      }
    }
  }

```
I hope the comments were explanatory enough. When the `addTask` method is called, we will get the value of `newTask`, `trim()` it and save it in a new variable called `task`.

If `task` evaulatues to true, which it would except if `task` is an empty string, push an object to the `taskList` array with two properties: `text` is set to the task variable  while `checked` is set to false. `checked` is what we will use to track the checked state of each task.

By setting `this.newTask` to an empty string, the value of our input will be cleared since they are bound together using the `v-model` directive.

You can switch to the results tab and add a few todos to see this in action. Notice that once you press the enter key, a new object containing the todo item is pushed to the `taskList` array except if your todo item is in fact an empty string.

#### Displaying our todo items

Now that we can add add tasks to our `taskList` array convieniently, we need a way to render the each list item in the app. Remember we have already setup the skeleton for how each task will look like. All we need to do now is render the our list based on the contents of the `taskList` array.

The first step is to use the `v-for` directive to render the items in our `taskList` array.

```html
<li v-for="task in taskList"></li>
```
In the earlier part of this tutorial, when we were setting up the skeleton of our app, I mentioned that the `label` element is where we will insert the text for each todo item. So this is where we will place our mustache binding.

```html
...
<label for="checkbox">{% raw %}{{ task.text }}{% raw %}</label>
...
```

All together now:

```html
 <ul class="list">

    <li v-for="task in taskList">

      <input type="checkbox" class="checkbox">

      <label for="checkbox">{% raw %}{{ task.text }}{% raw %}</label>

      <button class="delete">X</button>

    </li>

  </ul>
```

What this means is that each `task` in our `taskList` array will be rendered inside an `li` element that contains a `checkbox` for marking the task as completed, a `label` for holding the text and a `button` for deleting items.

Here's the current state of our app. Add some tasks and see it in action.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/12/embedded/result,js,html,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Feature 2 - Delete a single todo item

We have already setup our button for deleting tasks and we used css to display the button only when hovering on the task. Now lets register a new method that will be invoked when the button is clicked.

```html
...
<button class="delete" v-on:click="removeTask(task)">X</button>
...
```

```javascript
...
removeTask: function(task) {
  //$remove here works like array.splice()
  this.taskList.$remove(task);
}
...

```

Our button element triggers the `removeTask` method which takes one argument, `task`, which is the current array element being operated on.

Inside `removeTask` we used a built-in array extension in Vue called `$remove` which helps us remove an element from an array and trigger view updates.

Try it out, add some tasks and click the `X` button that appears on hovering over an item.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/13/embedded/result,js,html,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Feature 3 - Clear the whole list

This next feature is quite straightforward to implement. We need a way to clear the whole list once the `Clear List` button on the top panel is clicked.

```html
<button v-on:click="clearList">Clear List</button>
```

Now let's register the `clearList` method.

```javascript
...
clearList: function() {
  //Setting taskList to an empty array clears the whole list
  this.taskList = [];
}
...
```

Remember `taskList` is where our todos are stored so all we need to do to clear our list out is to set `taskList` to an empty array.

### Feature 4 - Mark a single item as completed

Marking tasks as done is a very common feature in any half-decent todo app and ours is not going to be any different.

Remember we already set the `checked` property on each task to `false`  when we add a new todo item. We only need a way to toggle it to true when a task is checked and vice versa.

We can do this by binding our checkbox to the `checked` property using the `v-model` directive.

```html
<input type="checkbox" class="checkbox" v-model="task.checked">
```

That's it. When the checkbox is selected the `checked` key toggled to true and vice versa.

Try it out:

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/15/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Now, we need to provide visual feedback in our app indicating that a task has been completed. Most to-do apps strike out the task and grey out the text so we'll do something similar here.

I have added some rules in the css to grey out the label element when the todo item in question has a class `done` on it's `li` element.

```css
...
.list li.done label {
  color: #d9d9d9;
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
...

```
So all we need to do is to add the `done` class to the `li` element when a task is checked and remove it when the task is unchecked. We will use another Vue.js directive to achieve this: `v-bind`.

Manipulating an element's class is commonplace in Front-End development and with `v-bind`, we can dynamically toggle classes on an element based on computed properties in an object.

For example:

```html
<div v-bind:class="{header: isHeader}"></div>
```

```javascript
data: {
  isHeader: true,
}
```

The result is

```html
<div class="header"></div>
```

If `isHeader`changed to false by some interaction, the `header` class is removed from the `div` automatically.

Let's go ahead and use `v-bind` to dynamically toggle the `done` class on our `li` element by finding out if a task is checked or not.

```html
<li v-for="task in taskList" v-bind:class="{done: task.checked}">
...

...
</li>
```

If `task.checked` returns true, the `done` class is enabled on the `li` element and vice versa.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/16/embedded/result,html,js,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

### Feature 5 - Mark all items as completed

For our final user story, we need a way to mark all todo items as completed with one click. We will use the checkbox with the id of `mark-all` in the top panel to mark or unmark all items. Additionally, when we select all the checkboxes one by one, the `#mark-all` checkbox will also get selected.

Before we can select or unselect all items, we need a way to set the value of the `#mark-all` checkbox. We can do this by checking if there is at least one todo item in our `taskList` array and if so, we will check if all the tasks are selected or not

We will watch for changes in our Vue instance using `computed` properties. Basically they are used to change some data in the Vue instance based on some other data.

Let's create a new property `areAllSelected` in our `computed` object that will contnually watch for changes in our `taskList` array and change the value of `#mark-all` based on whether all the `checked` properties in the array return true.

```javascript
...
  computed: {
    areAllSelected: function() {
      //Check if every checked property returns true and if there is at least one todo item
      return this.taskList.every(function(task) {
        return task.checked;
      }) && this.taskList.length > 0;
    },
  },
...
```

The `every()` method tests whether all the elements in the `taskList` array passes the test implemented by the provided function and returns true if a truthy value is returned by the callback function otherwise it returns false.

Next, just as we did while implementing the previous feature , we will bind the checked property on the `#mark-all`to the value returned by `areAllSelected` like this:

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="mark-all"  v-bind:checked="areAllSelected">
```

What this means that if `areAllSelected` returns true, the checked property will be enabled on the element, otherwise it will be disabled.

Try it out. Add a few tasks and mark them as done one by one. You will see that once all the items have been marked as completed, the `#mark-all` checkbox will also be selected. 

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/17/embedded/result,js,html,css" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

The final thing we need to implement is to select or unselect all items with the `#mark-all` checkbox.

To do this, let's register a new method called `selectAll`:

```javascript
...
selectAll: function(task) {
      //targetValue is set to the opposite of areAllSelected
      var targetValue = this.areAllSelected ? false : true;
      //we use a for loop to set the checked state of all items to the target value
      for (var i = 0; i < this.taskList.length; i++) {
        this.taskList[i].checked = targetValue;
      }
    }
...
```

Finally, lets use the `v-on` directive on our `#mark-all` element to summon `selectAll`.

```html
<input type="checkbox" id="mark-all" v-bind:checked="areAllSelected" v-on:click="selectAll">
```

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/ayoisaiah/v4p20ekz/19/embedded/js,html,css,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


That concludes my tutorial. I hope you have learnt the basics of Vue.js and how you can use it to build web interfaces.
