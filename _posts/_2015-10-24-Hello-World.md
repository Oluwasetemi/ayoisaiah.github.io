Hi guys,

It's been a while since I blogged about my progress in learning Web development which is mainly due to the fact that I couldn't find the time amongst other pressing commitments.

Another reason is that there's nothing new to report. Learning to code has been an off and on thing for me with school, work and other personal projects getting in the way.

However, I've made significant progress since I last blogged. I've polished up my CSS a bit, learnt SASS, learnt git, and improved my JavaScript a bit on Free Code Camp.

##Project

Right now, I'm working on building my first website from scratch. No prizes for guessing it's going to be my portfolio website.

My major goal here is to bring all the parts of what I've learnt so far into a complete project. It will be a very simple one-page website with clean design, nothing too fancy. Just something to start off with.

###Tools I'm using

- Skeleton CSS grid
- animate.css
- SASS
- jQuery

It's half done at the moment and you can view the the current state of the website [here]().

##In other news...

I've moved away from WordPress and will be writing here from now on. I just want to be working in a developer environment as often as I can using git, command line e.t.c.

Thanks for reading and see you again later.
