   Hi, I'm Ayo.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm a freelance Front-End Developer and tech enthusiast focusing on web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  </p>
  <p>
   I've always loved computers since I was young and in 2015, that interest developed into a desire to learn to program.
  </p>
  <p>
   I've been learning to code through
   <a href="https://freecodecamp.com/">
    Free Code Camp
   </a>
   for a while now and finished the Front-End section last May. My goal is to finish all four certification levels, however long that takes, on the way to becoming a Full-Stack Developer.
  </p>
  <p>
   On this blog, I will be writing articles and tutorials about the stuff I learn each week as well as my thoughts on some of the technologies I use.
  </p>
  <p>
   I hope you find useful and interesting stuff here. If you do, consider subscribing to my newsletter to get my articles delivered to your inbox.
