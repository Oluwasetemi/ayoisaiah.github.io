Hello there!

Thanks for checking out my website, I hope you find interesting and useful stuff here.

I'm from Lagos, Nigeria and I'm currently learning Full-Stack JavaScript via [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecamp.com/ayoisaiah).

Right from my childhood, I've always loved computers so it was quite natural for me to develop an interest in building software.

So far, it's been going good. I've learnt a lot and [built stuff](http://codepen.io/ayoisaiah) along the way. Last May, I claimed the first of four certifications offered by Free Code Camp.

I know just how hard learning to code can be and it's really easy to get lost and confused if you allow yourself to be influenced by the ever-changing technological landscape.

In the beginning, I wasted a lot of time dabbling in different stacks and ultimately achieved nothing in anyone of them.

But over time, I discovered quite a few strategies that helped me clear out all the distractions that hindered my progress allowing me to focus on only the most important things.

And this has subsequently helped me make significant advancements in my coding journey up to the point of getting paid to write code.

This blog is my way of sharing all the strategies that I have used to accelerate my learning and become a more productive individual overall.

If you want to get exclusive access to my content as well as learn about the tools and and techniques that I use to stay productive, you can [subscribe]({{ site.baseurl }}/subscribe/) to my weekly newsletter.
