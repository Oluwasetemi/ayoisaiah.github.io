I'm learning Web Development via [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com) and I'm on my way to building stuff that will solve real world problems. I will be writing about my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, coding in general plus other stuff about how I stay productive on a daily basis.
